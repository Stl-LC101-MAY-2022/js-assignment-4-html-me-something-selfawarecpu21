               <h2>My first picture</h2>
               <p>I got my first camera in 2019, it is a Canon Rebel T6. This is the first night time picture I took with it. My curiosity for space grew from there. </p>

                  <h2> My Telescope</h2>
                  <p>This is my current Astrophotography setup, the mount, two cameras, and other accessories connect to my computer. I use an open source astronomy software called KStars to control each of these components in a single suite. I point the scope to the North so I can get the star Polaris in view. This star is what allows us to know where we are at in space. Its called a Polar coordinate system, from here I can slew to any target in the sky above. KStars compares the first picture taken from the telescope and compares it to a match in a database with known star positions. This is called astronmetry.   </p>

                     <h2>Eagle Nebula</h2>
                     <p>The <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/messier-16-the-eagle-nebula">Hubble</a> image of this Nebula is amazing. The reason for the excess green lies in the camera sensor I use. The camera is a One Shot Color, so it has a thing called a bayer filter. This filter is a grid of red(1/4), green(1/2), blue(1/4) filters that lay on top of the photosites(the things that turns a photon into an electron). So the camera sensor inherently collects more green than red and blue.  </p>

                        <h2>Whirlpool galaxy</h2>
                        <p>When I process the pictures, I have to correct for the overflow of green, and white balance the image. This image has a a deviation of red but is color balanced for the most part. the lines in this image are from planes crossing the field of view. I can typically edit these types of things out once I have a lot of pictures of the same object, I will stack all the images and by doing that it will cancel out the noise and give me a greater signal to noise ratio, hence delete stuff that was only in one or two photos plus the back ground noise caused by the camera </p>

                           <h2>Andromeda Galaxy</h2>
                           <p>This is my all time favorite night time object. In the sky the Andromeda galaxy is 6 times larger than a full moon. It doesnt appear that way to up though because of the light pollution caused by the core of the Milkyway. This galaxy will also likely collide with our Milkyway in about 4 billion years. Cant wait to be around for that</p>

                              <p>I took this picture somewhere in Missouri, I am most proud of this Milkyway picture. I cant wait to live in Arizona where the sky is very dark so I can nerd out on my hobby all the time</p>
